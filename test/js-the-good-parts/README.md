- chapter 3 -

The simple types of JavaScript are `numbers`, `strings`, `booleans` (true and false), `null`, and `undefined`.
**All other values are objects. **

Numbers, strings, and booleans are object-like in that they have methods, but they are **immutable**.
Objects in JavaScript are mutable keyed collections.
In JavaScript, arrays are objects, functions are objects, regular expressions are objects, and, of course, objects are objects.

An object is a container of properties, where a property has a name and a value.
A property name can be any string, including the empty string.
A property value can be any JavaScript value except for `undefined`.
